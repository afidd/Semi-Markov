This is a header-only library. The only reason to compile it
is to run examples or tests. Requirements to use the headers,
and to build the examples, are Boost 1.54 or later
and a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard. This
has been tested with Clang and GCC.

1) Determine the flavor of your boost libraries. The names of Boost
binaries may contain extra information, most commonly ending in "-mt",
such as libboost_system-mt.so. Locate your libraries with
"locate libboost_chrono" or, on the mac, "mdfind -name libboost_chrono"
and ensure you have a full set of one of the
variants. If your library sits somewhere like
/usr/local/boost_1_54_0mt/lib/libboost_chrono-mt.so, then build
with the following options to configure.

  ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/boost_1_54_0mt --enable-variant=-mt

2) Modify the destination directory by adding a flag to configure.

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME

3) Modify the compiler and linker flags.

  ./configure CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=native"

All of these sample flags can be used in combination, and help
is found with ./configure --help.

4) Lastly, make the examples and install the headers.

  make
  make install
