AFIDD: Semi-Markov
=======================================

A C++ library to do stochastic simulations
in continuous time, of discrete-event models. This library permits
non-contant hazard rates, so that distributions do not need to be
exponentially-distributed. It focuses on defining a system with
survival analysis and then simulating that system exactly.
The tool is designed for modeling disease processes in concert with
movement, ecology, farm management and economics, but the tool is quite
general in its capabilities as a exact discrete event system in continuous time.
